Clone the repo, make sure you have pygame installed and then run "RunZerga.py". 

Right now this game is just bare bones with no graphics. I am mostly just setting up the menu and controls.

How to "play":
- TOP RIGHT MENU:
    1. GREEN RESOURCE BUILDING.
    2. BLUE RESOURCE BUILDING.
    3. MAIN BUILDING.
        a. Click the placed building.
        b. Press "A" on the keyboard to spawn a troop.
            i) Once spawned, middle mouse to fire a projectile.
            ii) "SPACE" button will make troops move to cursor.
            iii) Right click to make that troop shoot a projectile.


Things you can do:
- Claim resource nodes.
- Place your main building.
    - Spawn basic troops.
    - Move that troop.
        - Troops cannot move through enemy buildings or unclaimed resource nodes.
    - Make that troop shoot.

Things the enemy can do:
- Place its own main building.


TODO:
- Add data gathering from USER EVENTS.
- Create a decision tree.
- Train decision tree every n seconds.
- Make the enemy make moves based on the decision tree.
