Clone the repo, make sure you have pygame installed and then run "RunZerga.py". 

Right now this game is just bare bones with no graphics. I am mostly just setting up the menu and controls.

How to "play":
- TOP RIGHT MENU:
    1. GREEN RESOURCE BUILDING
    2. BLUE RESOURCE BUILDING
    3. MAIN BUILDING
        a. Click the placed building.
        b. Press "A" on the keyboard to spawn a troop.
        c. Once spawned, middle mouse to fire a projectile.
        d. "SPACE" button will make troops move to cursor.

Things you can do:
- Claim resource nodes
- Place your main building
    - Spawn basic troops
    - Move that troop
        - Troops cannot move through enemy buildings or unclaimed resource nodes
    - Make that troop shoot


TODO:
- Add data gathering from USER EVENTS.
- Create a decision tree.
- Train decision tree every n seconds.
- Make the enemy make moves based on the decision tree.
